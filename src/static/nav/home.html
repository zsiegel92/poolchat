<h1>Welcome to GroupThere!</h1>
<p>GroupThere is a tool to help large groups coordinate carpooling for their events. If you and your 1-50 friends are planning to be at the same place at the same time, registering your event with GroupThere will ensure that the whole group shares rides optimally.</p>


<h3><b>What does GroupThere do, exactly?</b></h3>
<p>After team members have joined the event, GroupThere's servers work hard to figure out the optimal assignment of riders to cars, so that everyone can get to the event with as little total time in cars as possible.</p>

<h3><b>How do I use GroupThere?</b></h3>
<p>Users can either join an existing team or create a team. Without a team, users can't do much; team members can register events!</p>
<p>Once a team member registers an event, it becomes available to everyone in the team. Team members can log into GroupThere and join the event easily. Then, <b>a few hours before the event (specified by the user), instructions are emailed to EVERYONE who is attending the event.</b></p>

<h3><b>What do 'instructions' look like?</b></h3>
<p>Instructions are nicely-worded itineraries containing all the information carpoolers need, and none that they don't. Here's an example:</p>
